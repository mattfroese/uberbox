Ramblings while I organize this repo

Slide gets up down left right
Specify individual transitions by passing multiple transition objects to the transition option in an array!
Methods! to, next, previous, pause, play, playPause
Bind to events! onNext, onPrevious, onPlay, onPause, onTo, onTransition, onTransitionComplete, onInit, onInitComplete, onInitEvents, onStartTimer, onClearTimer
Added waitForTransition option
If waitForTransition is false the behaviour for rapidly cycling through slides has improved by finishing the transitions immediatly
Customize the pager, thumber and slideshow list elements. Use ul > li's or straight divs, whatever floats your boat.
